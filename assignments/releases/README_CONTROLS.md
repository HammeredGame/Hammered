Summoning the hammer will make the hammer follows a straight line trajectory from the position the hammer was dropped at towards the player. At the end of the trajectory, the character catches and moves while carrying the hammer.

Camera angles alternate between four four (4) predetermined camera angles.

The "1", "2", "3" and "4" keys for the camera controls on the keyboard are from the alphanumeric keys section of the keyboard, not on the numeric keypad.

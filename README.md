# HAMMERED
# :video_game: Game Programming Lab 2023 - House Rapture - Team2

Bring your creativity with you and embark on a journey through the world of Hammered, a unique 3D single-player puzzle game based on the concept of Thor's magic hammer. 

Your player wakes up on an island, with hazy memories of yesterday. Next to you is a magic hammer. Maybe this is Thor's! Play as the mortal main character trying to bring the hammer back to Thor, and guide them as their footsteps get hindered by puzzles and challenges that inhibit the islands that lead to Thor. The puzzles are solved using Hammered's core mechanic, which adds a new interesting touch to third-person puzzle games, and is sure to offer you lots of unique gameplay.

Master your ability to use the magical hammer in creative ways to get around obstacles in each puzzle level and aim for the exit. Laugh and embrace the story and narrative provided on this magical archipelago where godly magic is apparently everywhere. Come on, immerse yourself in the world of Hammered!
